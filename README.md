# Champs DB
This contains the data needed to create a postgres database for the **Champs in the Making** website.
It contains data from the various matchups and the pokemon involved.

## Matchup Data
The matchups are painstakenly created from the [Champs in the Making episodes](https://twitter.com/champsmaking). The original epsiodes were created by the wonderful people at the [Moonshot Podcast Network](https://moonshotpods.com/).  A separate project is also tracking the results [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ul83iwTB248GFSA9Z9G32g6fZXVt0sO0mU_cnS54RE8)!
